# PyRegen v1.2

**Regenerative cooling analysis software for small and medium scale liquid-propellant rocket chambers and nozzles.**

PyRegen computes the thermal and hydraulic behaviour of a regeneratively cooled rocket engine. Given engine operating conditions, nozzle geometry, coolant properties, and cooling channel geometry, it solves the coupled heat transfer problem station by station along the nozzle wall, producing wall temperatures, heat flux, and coolant state at each station, with support for both 1D and 2D wall conduction models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/creatorandrew86/PyRegen-v1.2.git
   cd PyRegen-v1.2
   '''

2. Install dependencies:
   '''bash
   pip install rocketcea coolprop dearpygui numpy scipy
   '''

> **Note:** RocketCEA requires NASA CEA to be installed separately. See the [RocketCEA documentation](https://rocketcea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installCEA.html) for instructions.

---

## Usage

'''bash
python main.py
'''

Once the GUI opens, follow these steps:

1. Set **engine parameters** and run CEA to compute combustion gas properties
2. Define **nozzle geometry** and generate the contour
3. Set **coolant** and **channel parameters**
4. Choose the **wall conduction model** (1D or 2D) and gas/coolant-side correlations
5. Run the **solver**
6. Use the **Output** section to generate plots, export result files, or view the summary results window

## Inputs

### Engine Parameters
- Oxidizer and fuel selection
- Chamber pressure (Pc)
- Mixture ratio (MR)
- Mass flow rate or throat radius (Rt)

### Nozzle Parameters
- Contraction ratio (CR), expansion ratio (ε), characteristic length (L*)
- Nozzle type (conical / bell), length percentage, wall angle, contour resolution

### Coolant Parameters
- Coolant fluid selection
- Mass flow rate, inlet temperature, inlet pressure

### Channel Parameters
- Wall material and thickness
- Number of cooling channels
- Channel width and height control points (axial position, `cw`, `ch`)
- Interpolation type (linear / cubic spline), jacket resolution

### Solver Options

## Wall Models

PyRegen supports two selectable wall conduction models, both accessed through the model registry:

- **1D model (`wall_1d.py`)** — treats the wall as a simple through-thickness conduction path between the hot gas side and coolant side. Fast to solve, suitable for quick sizing and channel geometries where fin effects are negligible.
- **2D model (`wall_2d.py`)** — resolves conduction across the channel cross-section, accounting for the fin effect of the land between adjacent channels. Produces a more accurate hot wall temperature distribution and land-tip temperature, at the cost of additional solve time per station.

The wall model is selected alongside the gas-side and coolant-side heat transfer correlations before running the solver, and results from either model populate the same per-station output arrays.

## Outputs

### Summary Results
